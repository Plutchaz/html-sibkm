                <p id="bugs-desc">
                    Most Bug Pokémon grow quickly and evolve sooner than other types. As a result, they are often very
                    weak. In Generation I, bugs were almost useless since the few Bug type moves available were very
                    weak. The situation improved in later games with better moves and an advantage against the Dark
                    type.
                    <br>
                    In Generations 1-3, all Bug type moves were categorized as Physical.

                <p id="dark-desc">
                    The Dark type was introduced in the second generation of Pokémon games as a measure to balance the
                    types. In particular, its resistance to Psychic cut down that type's advantage by a long way. When
                    paired with the Ghost type it was the only type combination to have no weaknesses prior to Gen 6.
                    <br>
                    In Generations 1-3, all Dark type moves were categorized as Special.

                <p id="poison-desc">
                    The Poison type is regarded as one of the weakest offensively. Prior to Pokémon X/Y it was
                    super-effective only against Grass (many of which are dual Poison so neutralizes the effect). It now
                    has an extra advantage against the new Fairy type. In the first generation it was also
                    super-effective against Bug but this was changed. It fares a little better defensively but its best
                    advantage is through status moves like Toxic.
                    <br>
                    In Generations 1-3, all Poison type moves were categorized as Physical.

                    There are relatively few Electric Pokémon; in fact only four were added in the third generation.
                    Most are based on rodents or inanimate objects.
                    <br>
                    <i>Electric Pokémon</i>
                    are very good defensively, being weak only to Ground moves. Eelektross is the only Pokémon to have
                    no type disadvantages due to its ability, Levitate.

                <p id="fairy-desc">
                    The Fairy type was introduced in Generation 6 - the first new type for more than 12 years! Its main
                    intention was to balance the type chart by reducing the power of dragons, while also giving an
                    offensive boost to the Poison and Steel types. Several old Pokémon were retyped and new Pokémon
                    introduced. There are only around 60 Fairy type Pokémon (depending on how you count alternate forms
                    or mega evolutions), in total slightly above Ice.

                <p id="fighting-desc">
                    Fighting Pokémon are strong and muscle-bound, often based on martial artists. Fighting moves are
                    super-effective against five other types (as is Ground), making them very good offensively. Most
                    Fighting type moves are in the Physical category, for obvious reasons.

                    Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the
                    three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
                    players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire
                    variation starter is often a plus.

                    Ghosts are rare Pokémon, and the only type to have two immunities. In total there are just 34 Ghost
                    type Pokémon (not including Megas/Formes), slightly above Ice.
                    <br>
                    In the first generation, Ghost moves has no effect on Psychic Pokémon, however, it was later changed
                    to be super-effective. When paired with the Dark type it was the only type combination to have no
                    weaknesses prior to Gen 6.

                    <br>
                    Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5 defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are
                    resistant to Grass moves. Furthermore, three type combos paired with Grass have 7 weaknesses:
                    Grass/Psychic, Grass/Ice, and Grass/Dark.

                    Ground is one of the strongest types offensively: it is super-effective against five other types (as
                    is Fighting) and Earthquake is one of the strongest moves in the game with power and accuracy both
                    100. Unfortunately, many Ground type Pokémon are dual Rock types, lumbering them with 4x Grass and
                    Water disadvantages.

                    Ice type Pokémon are now the rarest of all types: there are only around 60 in total (depending on
                    how you count alternate forms or mega evolutions). They are ranked quite well defensively in terms
                    of stats, although multiple type weaknesses let them down. Some are based on typical Arctic
                    creatures like seals or yaks, while others are more mythical.

                    The Psychic type has few outright strengths, however, it also has few weaknesses. In the first
                    generation it ended up being massively overpowered, mainly due to a complete lack of powerful Bug
                    moves, its only weakness. Furthermore, a mistake in the game meant that Ghost-type moves had no
                    effect on Psychic (although this only affected the low-powered Lick). Generation 2 rectified the
                    situation with the addition of the Dark type along with better Pokémon and moves of all types.

                    From Pokémon X/Y onwards, it lost its Ghost and Dark resistance, those types now dealing neutral
